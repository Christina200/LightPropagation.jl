# LightPropagation

## Purpose

LightPropagation provides a set of tools to model and analyze the propagation of light in turbid media written in the [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org/).
The current library supports simulating the time-resolved reflectance in the forward direction under the diffusion approximation for 3 different geometries:
- __Semi-infinite__ 
- __Slabs__
- __Parallelepipeds__

## Usage

The easiest way to install julia is by [downloading julia](https://julialang.org/downloads/) from the offical site and following the [platform specific installations](https://julialang.org/downloads/platform/). 

Launch Julia and open Julia's package manager by typing `]` in the REPL. You should see the command line change from `julia>` to `(@v1.5) pkg>`. (The @v1.x will display your current version) Once the package has clones, backspace to bring back the `julia>` in your REPL and type `using LightPropagation` as shown below.

```julia
(@v1.5) pkg> add "https://github.com/heltonmc/LightPropagation.git"

julia> using LightPropagation

```
