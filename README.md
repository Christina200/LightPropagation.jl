# LightPropagation

## Purpose

LightPropagation provides a set of tools to model and analyze the propagation of light in turbid media written in the [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org/).
The current library supports simulating light propagation in the forward direction under the diffusion approximation for time-resolved reflectance for 3 different geometries:
- __Semi-infinite__ 
- __Slabs__
- __Parallelepipeds__
