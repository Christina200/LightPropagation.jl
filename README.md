# LightPropagation

##Purpose

LightPropagation provides a set of tools to model and analyze the propagation of light in turbid media written in the [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org/).
The current library supports simulating light propagation in the forward direction under the diffusion approximation for time-resolved reflectance for 3 different geometries:
1. Semi-infinite 
2. Slabs
3. Parallelepiped
